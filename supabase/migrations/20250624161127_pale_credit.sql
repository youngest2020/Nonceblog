  # Fix RLS policies to restore admin functionality

  1. Problem
    - Previous fix removed admin access completely
    - Need to restore admin functionality without infinite recursion

  2. Solution
    - Use auth.jwt() to check admin status from JWT claims
    - Add proper policies for blog posts and other tables
    - Ensure admins can access all necessary data
