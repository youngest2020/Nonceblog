-- Remove duplicate post analytics records, keeping the most recent
DELETE FROM post_analytics 
WHERE id NOT IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT ON (post_id) id
  FROM post_analytics
  ORDER BY post_id, created_at DESC
);

-- Remove duplicate promotion analytics records, keeping the most recent
DELETE FROM promotion_analytics 
WHERE id NOT IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT ON (promotion_id) id
  FROM promotion_analytics
  ORDER BY promotion_id, created_at DESC
);

-- Add unique constraints to prevent future duplicates
ALTER TABLE post_analytics 
ADD CONSTRAINT post_analytics_post_id_unique 
UNIQUE (post_id);

ALTER TABLE promotion_analytics 
ADD CONSTRAINT promotion_analytics_promotion_id_unique 
UNIQUE (promotion_id);

-- Update RLS policies for better analytics tracking
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can insert post analytics" ON post_analytics;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can read post analytics" ON post_analytics;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can update post analytics" ON post_analytics;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can delete post analytics" ON post_analytics;

-- Create new policies that allow proper analytics tracking
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can insert post analytics"
  ON post_analytics
  FOR INSERT
  TO anon, authenticated
  WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can read post analytics"
  ON post_analytics
  FOR SELECT
  TO anon, authenticated

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can update post analytics"

  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can delete post analytics"
  ON post_analytics
  FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);

-- Reset analytics counters to more realistic values
UPDATE post_analytics 
SET 
  views = LEAST(views, 10),
  unique_views = LEAST(unique_views, views),
  engagement_rate = CASE 
    WHEN views > 0 THEN ((likes + shares + comments_count)::decimal / views) * 100
    ELSE 0
  END
WHERE views > 10;

-- Add helpful indexes for analytics queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_post_analytics_last_viewed ON post_analytics(last_viewed DESC);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_promotion_analytics_created_at ON promotion_analytics(created_at DESC);
